Exercise II:
Drop an egg off floor f = n/2, if the egg breaks, move down, if it doesn't move up. Repeat this process by moving halfway between the floor f, and the lowest/highest possible floor that has been tested. Stop when you have found floor f where the egg does not break and floor f+1 does break.
